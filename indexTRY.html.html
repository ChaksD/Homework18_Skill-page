        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I believe in creating a more humane and empathetic world.
            </p>

            <p>Prior to my UX/UI journey, I was an Owners Corporation Manager 
            for over a decade. I felt increasingly unfulfilled and was craving 
            a creative career where I could realize more ambitious ideas. 
            </p>

            <p>My “aha moment” was when I was dealing with a web development company 
            to develop an App for a building I managed.
            When I learned about the role of UX/UI designer, I knew it was something 
            I had to pursue. </p>

            <p>The fundamentals of the two fields are the same, from constantly
            looking out for the needs of clients to possessing a desire to solve complex issues 
            by coming up with new and innovative solutions.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I am frequently seen making mixed media sculpture and paintings.
